<h1 style="font-size:30">Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
      
 <p style="line-height:30%">The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <cite><strong>Leonhard Euler</strong></cite> was 
born in Basel,<p>
<p style="line-height:50%">Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of 
mathematics, <cite><strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong></cite>. In 1731<p>
<p style="line-height:50%">Euler became a professor of physics 
and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.<p>
<p style="line-height:50%">Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and 
<p style="line-height:50%">papers. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>

<br />

<p style="line-height:50%">He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's 
work, <cite>Introductio</cite> </p>
<p style="line-height:50%"><cite>in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite>, remained a standard textbook in the field for 
well over a century.</p> 
<p style="line-height:50%">For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote 
<cite> Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772),</cite></p> 
<p style="line-height:50%">giving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the 
time.</p>

<br />

<p style="line-height:50%">One can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying Euler. 
Notations still in us</p> 
<p style="line-height:50%">today, such as <var>e</var> and &pi; , were introduced in Euler's writings. 
Leonhard Euler died in 1783,</p> 
<p style="line-height:50%">leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of<p>
    <p style="line-height:50%">mathematics.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:20">The Most Beautiful Theorem?</h1>

<p>Euler's Equation:</p>



<p style="font-size:10">cos<var>(x)</var> + <var>i</var>sin<var>(x)</var> = <var>e</var><sup>(ix)</sup></p>


<p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, 
and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive
the identity</p>


<p style="font-size:10"><var>e</var><sup>(&pi; <var>i</var>)</sup> + 1 = 0<p>

<p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &pi;, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in
a single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers 
conducted by <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> magazine named 
Euler's Identity as the 
most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.
